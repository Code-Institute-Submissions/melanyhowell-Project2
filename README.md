## Project Requirements

Main technologies need to be used
    - HTML, CSS and JavaScript
    - Optional: jQuery or any other JavaScript libraries, external APIs.

Mandatory Requirements
    - Dynamic Front End Project: Write custom JavaScript, HTML and CSS code to create a front-end web application consisting of one or more HTML pages with significant interative functionality.
    - Site Responses: Use JavaScript to have the site produce relevant responses dependent on users' actions.
    - Information Architecture: Incorporate a main navigation menu (unless irrelevant) and structured layout (you might want to use Bootstrap to accomplish this).
    - Documentation: Write a README.md file for your project that explains what the project does and the value that it provides to its users.
    - Version Control: Use Git & GitHub for version control.
    - Attribution: Maintain clear separation between code written by you and code from external sources (e.g. libraries or tutorials). Attribute any code from external sources to its source via comments above the code and (for larger dependencies) in the README.
    -Deployment: Deploy the final version of your code to a hosting platform such as GitHub Pages.

## User Exerience: UX

### Initial Concept
I wanted to incorporated an old style game style to my website as my website would be no more than 3 pages and fairly easy to navigate.
With a simple card turn memory game as the feature.

### User Stories

Being the primary user I expect the following;

+ Want a game that is easy to play and reset. 
+ With a move and timer counter that I can follow to improve on.
+ If I need instructions to play the game they should be easy to navigate to aswell as a way of contacting the websites owners.
+ Links to owners social sites and developers links.

As the owner I want the following from my site;

+ Easy and fun to play, Make player want to keep playing.
+ Ease of use of website
+ Ways for people to get in contact with us

As a developer I am looking to provide the following;

+ No accesibility issues
+ A game that is enjoyable
+ Satisfies the above wants of the user and owner


### Wireframes

I created my Wireframes using [Balsamiq](https://balsamiq.com). 

From the original designs I have changed a few aspects.
+ Nav bar loaction
+ Contact button on footer removed for consistency on every page
+ Score system originally though was not practical now changed to timer and moves tracking.
+ How to page changed from popup to webpage as menu option limited use of popup function.

#### Home/Game Page

#### Contact Page

![Contact Page Wireframes](assets/readmeimages/wireframe-contactpage.png)

#### How To Play Popup/Page

![How To Page Wireframes](assets/readmeimages/wireframe-popup.png)


### Site Structure

Memory Game Website consists of 3 pages the Home PAge which hold the game, the "How To" Page which gives instructions on how to play, and the "Contact" Page which allows the user to email directly or access the owners or developers social netwroks for more info.

### Colour Pallette

I wanted my game site to have a happy colour that wouldn't prevent the font of the pages to be changed too drastically from black or gray.


### Typography

The fonts I selected were;
+ Bungee 
+ Prosto One
+ Righteous
That have been imported from [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/).
I chose these fonts as they all have an element of the old style gaming arcade games to them which helps lend to the style of a simple game look.

### Imagery

The imagery I choose was to be as generic as possible but something that would still be relatable and appealing, my one wish while searching for compatible and similar style cartoons was more variety in colour as I feel the images are strongly based on Gray.
